In this project, we demonstrate our implementation of Wavefront Path Tracing on the GPU. To enhance the performance of the algorithm, we have utilized multiple important sampling and a binning BVH acceleration structure. The scene supports meshes and triangles as primitives. Moreover, we also incorporated a skybox for realistic environmental lighting. With the use of these advanced techniques, we aim to showcase the capabilities and benefits of GPU-accelerated path tracing in computer graphics.

In this project, we have created a detailed and complex scene consisting of 116 meshes and over 1.1 million triangles, with over 280 MB of textures. Our scene is a beautifully crafted low-poly isometric room, which we sourced from the website free3d under the name "Low Poly Isometric Room."
